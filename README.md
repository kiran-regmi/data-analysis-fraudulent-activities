# data-analysis-fraudulent-activities
Commonwealth Bank to stay up to date with the latest fraud detection technologies and strategies to minimize risk. By detecting and stopping fraud, the bank can protect its customers, employees and reputation while also enhancing the resilience of its financial system.

**In this project,** we will create a dashborad to include the following matrics:
* Count by Category, Fraudulent transactions, Age and Merchant.
* Fraud detected by Age, Category, Step (month) and Gender.

**To solve the following problem:**
* Which gender performed the most fraudulent activities and in what category?
* Which age group performed the most fraudulent activities and to what merchant
